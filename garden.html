        <p class="lead">The Memorial Garden is a garden consecrated for the sacred disposition of ashes of loved ones who have died and passed into the greater life of God. It is especially fitting that such a resting place be in the arms of the church. Burial in sight of font and altar reminds us that our loves, our losses and our hopes are within the one life of God.</p>

          <h3>Use of the Memorial Garden</h3>
          <p>Although the Garden is especially for the use of parishioners and their families, it is freely available to all.<br>
          Unlike a cemetery, the Memorial Garden has no grave markers. A record of burials is kept in the church, and there is a map available showing the location of interments.<br><br>
          No urns are used, but the cremated remains are buried in a bio-degradable container. The ashes may also be scattered, or the family may prefer that some of the ashes be interred, and some scattered on top of the earth. The Funeral Director prepares the ashes specifically for this type of interment, and should be informed at the time of cremation that the ashes will be interred in the Church Memorial Garden. The Funeral Director will also furnish an appropriate container.<br><br>
          All interments are made by arrangement with the Rector of St. Barnabas' Church.<br><br>
          There is no fee for committal in the Memorial Garden. Donations, however, are readily accepted for the upkeep of the Garden.</p>

        <h3>Maintenance and Upkeep</h3>
        
        <p>The Memorial Garden Committee maintains plans for the garden. No gifts of plants, statuary and the like are accepted, though monetary donations are always welcome.<br><br>

        The cross, designed as a gift by local artist and friend of the parish Fred Ploeger, is closely based on the pattern of some of the ancient Celtic crosses of Europe. It is hand-carved from local granite by sculptor Gary Sassi of Barre, Vermont, and was given to the parish by a generous donor.<br><br>

        The teak wood bench is made of wood, sustainably grown in Africa. The supply of this "green" timber is monitored by the makers, Wood Classics, with a view to ensuring renewable timber and fair labor practices for those who harvest the wood.<br><br>

        The natural stone wall around the East perimeter of the Garden is a work-in-progress. It is built of stones brought by parishioners and friends of the parish from places that have meaning for them. Anyone is invited to place a stone on the wall from a place that has significance in their life. Thus the low stone wall becomes itself a marker rich in the memories of those who have helped build it.<br><br>

        The Garden was designed by Carolyn Hooper Goetinck. Jean Lawe and Carolyn Hooper Goetinck designed the plantings, and implemented the design in the Spring of 2000. The Garden was dedicated, and the ground consecrated for Christian burial, on Pentecost, June 11, 2000, which was also the Feast of St. Barnabas.</p>
